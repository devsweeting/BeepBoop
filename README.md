## Description

This is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:
* Numebrs that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* NUmebrs that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

## Support and contact details

_{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}_

## Technologies Used

_{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}_
